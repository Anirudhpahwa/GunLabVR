GunLab – VR Weapon System (Unreal Engine 5)

GunLab is a VR weapon system built in Unreal Engine 5 using Blueprints.
The goal of this project is to create realistic, hands-on gun interactions that can be reused in different VR shooting games.

The focus of the project is on interaction, weapon logic, and system design rather than visuals.

What’s in the project

-VR grabbing implemented using Unreal Engine sockets

-Primary and secondary hand grabbing

-Reloading system with magazine insertion and removal

-Gun slide interaction with validated grab positions

-Fire modes including Safe, Semi-Automatic, and Automatic

-Shooting system with proper weapon state checks

-Suppressor support with different sounds when attached or detached

-Bullet impact decals on surfaces

-Shell casing ejection and gun smoke using Niagara

-Secondary grab for improved aiming stability and recoil control

-Clean and commented Blueprints for easier understanding

How it’s built

-Built entirely using Blueprints

-State-driven weapon logic to prevent invalid actions

-Modular system design so the same logic can be reused for other weapons

-Designed with VR usability and future expansion in mind
